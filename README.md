# Purpose

To provide access to Mars One Genesis community created works and the necessary works licensed from Australia AI Pty Ltd (Australia). Such works were originally created for the purposes of being used in a software simulation. Note the application of the Attribution 3.0 License for all community created works. Please attribute works to Mars One's "Genesis" (a Mars colony simulation project) whenever there are no other attribution instructions found in "Concept" or "Production" folders.

# Concept

Concepts ("Concepts" folder) are intellectual property and attribution is necessary. They are also great to share and you never know what feedback you will get. Some models or scenes are very simple but very relevant to this project. 

# Production

Products ("Production" folder) are intellectual property and attribution is necessary. Completed works, for this project, work with a number of graphics engines. Ensuring models are fit for purpose, even when the simulation software is as varied as working in the browser or working on an Android tablet, requires a minimum of 3 files be produced. Files include:

* .FBX file that, when imported into Unity, works as expected.

* .GLTF file that is the equivalent of the .FBX file.

* .BLEND file that abstracts features to show 3D models as NURBS data.

* Any external file dependencies, such as those containing texture or roughness data.
